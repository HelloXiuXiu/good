    <span style="color: #5e88a2;"><b>GOOD is a creative accelerator. </b></span><span class="about_gap">______</span> We believe a creative process is a matter of talent, not time. We work for every person, brand &amp; organisation that believes in the unreasonable power of creativity.<br><br>
    <span style="color: #5e88a2;"><b>We are born with every new project. </b></span><span class="about_gap">_________</span> For every brief or business problem we build a tailor-made team of world class creative thinkers &amp; doers.<br><br>
    <span style="color: #5e88a2;"><b>We are the work, not the agency. </b></span><span class="about_gap">________________</span> Good is a temporary extension of your organisation. We are keen to work together with your internal talent and partner agencies. We do not have a ﬂoor space to rent or a CEO to please. We are working heads, not overhead.<br><br>
    <span style="color: #5e88a2;"><b>We don’t work for everyone. </b></span><span class="about_gap"> ________</span> We don’t work with everyone. We care about people &amp; our people. In everything we do, we aim for positive impact. Creativity is the simplest way to improve the world. Why waste it?<br><br>
    <span style="color: #5e88a2;"><b>We are honest. </b></span><span class="about_gap">________</span> This can be a problem. We always listen. We often disagree. We ask direct questions. We prefer shortcuts over marathons. We make mistakes, but never the same ones. We fail fast, to ﬁnd fast.<br><br>
